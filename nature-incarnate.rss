  <div>Yes, that's right! It's here <em>much</em> sooner than expected! We here in St. Louis are going to be shipping out the orders for those of you who ordered just <strong><em>Nature Incarnate</em></strong> and the foils starting <strong>next Monday, June the 19th</strong>. Thus, you have until that Monday morning to get your final addresses in and updated! That means that some of you who were anticipating July deliveries may have to update your address <em>again</em>. No worries, you know what to do: reach out to <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="d8bbb7b6acb9bbac98bfaabdb9acbdaaacb0b9b6bfb9b5bdabf6bbb7b5">[email&#160;protected]</a> <br><br>In fact, please don't hesitate to reach out to <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="bdded2d3c9dcdec9fddacfd8dcc9d8cfc9d5dcd3dadcd0d8ce93ded2d0">[email&#160;protected]</a> for any address (or otherwise) related reasons!<br><br>What about our foreign friends? Same as above! Board and Dice already has your <strong><em>Nature Incarnate! </em></strong>You may have different shipment timelines from our US friends, but you won't be too far off now. We're still waiting on information on other distribution centers, but we're obviously getting close to the wire! Get those surveys finished and addresses in!<br><br>We're so excited to get this shipment underway! We'll see you next update!<br><br>-Bailey]]></description>

  <div>Hello again, everyone! Some great news to share with you all this time around: <strong><em>Premium Token Pack #2 </em></strong>and the <strong><em>Nature Incarnate Foils</em></strong> are on a boat!

   <description><![CDATA[
  <div>Let’s celebrate, folks, <strong><em>Nature Incarnate</em></strong> is shipping! That’s right, the expansion is on its way! To us, that is. It has to make its way to our warehouse before we can start sending it to you. So, we aren’t completely down to the wire on changing addresses. We’ve got about a month of it crossing the ocean, then a few weeks to get to here in St. Louis. ]]></description>

   <description><![CDATA[
  <div>Good morning, everyone! Welcome back for a new update. We’ve got a short one for you this time around. We have some great news for you all: <strong><em>Nature Incarnate</em></strong> is getting ready to enter the pre-ship stage of the process! That’s right, production is wrapping up and soon will be put on the cargo containers for us. Then, it’s just a matter of time before it’s crossing the Pacific Ocean and heading right to us. Of course, there’s still the month that it takes for it to <em>cross</em> that ocean, but time will tell on exactly how long it takes. We’re on course and possibly even slightly ahead of schedule! Make sure we have your correct address!]]></description>
